SQL-Sales-data
Using SQL to provide insights and answers to business questions. This dataset includes columns such as revenue, costs, product category, sub category, age group etc. Business questions that were answered using SQL were
a. what country and product category generated the highest revenue?
b. What top 10 products that incurs the most cost to the business?
c. what country, product category and sub_category has an average revenue above or equal to 250? Knowing this would help determine what factors are likely to be the cause and what measures could be put in place to ensure that these numbers remain high

These and other questions were answered in this project
